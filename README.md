## Common Issues

### Can't install `win32gui`

For some reason, `win32gui` doesn't work in the latest version of python. However, it does work in older versions. As a solution, download `Python 3.6`, instead of the latest (see note). More information is in #4. NOTE: If you use Anaconda, create a Python 3.6 virtual envoirnment. Once you are using Python 3.6 (either from the Python website or from Anaconda), retry installing `win32gui`. If it doesn't work, let me know in issue #4.
